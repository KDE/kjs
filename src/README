This library provides an ECMAScript compatible interpreter. The ECMA standard
is based on well known scripting languages such as Netscape's JavaScript and
Microsoft's JScript.

I'm currently pursuing to be compliant with Edition 3 of ECMA-262. Postscript
and pdf versions of the standard are available at:

http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ecma-st/Ecma-262.pdf
for PDF and
http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm
for the standard page.

About 95% of the required features should be covered by now. Note that this
number covers the core language elements only. Features like the famous
roll-over buttons on the www are NOT part of the standard. Those extensions
are added via a module loaded dynamically by the KHTML Widget.

I'll provide some examples of how to extend this library for various needs at
a later point in time. Feel free to contact me via mail if you have any
questions on how to provide scripting capabilities for your application.

A debugger is being worked on.

Bug reports, patches or feedback of any kind is very welcome.
