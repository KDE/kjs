/**
 There are 2 levels at which instructions exist. First of all, there is
 an actual operation name, represent by the OpName enum. This is something like
 Op_IfJump. For each one of these, we have multiple bytecode instructions, such as
 OpByteCode_IfJump_Ibool_Iaddr and OpByteCode_IfJump_Rbool_Iaddr, with their
 names given in the OpByteCode_ enum.

 For each of these bytecode codes, there is an entry in the opsForOpCodes
 array, which provides an Op structure, which describes which parameters
 go where, and so on. The opSpecializations array lets one look up
 all these structures relevant for each OpName, so one can select
 the specific operation for each conceptual instruction.

 Besides parameter variants, there is also variation based on padding, with
 some bytecodes skipping 4 extra bytes after the opcode to make things 8-aligned.
 Those bytecodes are always 1 below their unaligned version
